# 🎙️ Voice-Activated Cookbook (Web App)

An interactive, **voice-enabled AI cookbook** that helps you decide what to cook, lists ingredients and utensils, and reads recipes out loud with a playful chef personality.  

This project is now a **Flask web application** with a stylish frontend, powered by:
- **OpenRouter (LLM API)** → for generating conversational recipe instructions.
- **Murf API** → for natural-sounding text-to-speech (TTS).
- **Flask** → for serving the app and handling API calls.
- **Vanilla JS + CSS** → for a fun, interactive frontend experience.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌟 Ask what you want to cook, and the Chef responds with ingredients, utensils, and steps.
- 🎧 Listen to responses using **Murf AI voices** directly in your browser.
- 💬 Text + audio responses are returned together for accessibility.
- ⚠️ Handles API errors gracefully and still shows the recipe text.
- 🎨 Classy, playful frontend (HTML + CSS + JS).
